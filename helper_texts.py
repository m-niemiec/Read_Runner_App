Hello! You are now on a help page for app Read Runner.

This app was created in order to help you read books and various texts faster.
It can be achieved by showing a word after word from given book in one place.
You will be able to consume contents of a book much faster because you won't need to actually 'move' your eyes in search for next word.
Try it!

On main screen you can see a list of you all books with your progress.

If you select a book, you will be greeted by a reading screen where words will be appearing in the center.
Central button with a triangle and a stripe will let you play and pause reading.
Two buttons on the left and right with arrows will let you go backward of forward by 10 words.
Above buttons you will see your progress in reading selected text with percentage.

On the main screen in bottom right corner you will see a little plus icon. By clicking that button you will be able to import new books and texts.
You will be able to copy a text from your clipboard or by selecting a file from your memory. Read Runner is accepting .TXT, .PDF and .MOBI files.

Please remember that you will also have to fill title and author fields manually.

On the preferences screen you will be able to change following settings:
 - reading speed
 - word size
 - word brightness
 
Reading speed is described in a number of words per minute. 60 shows you one word in each second.

Word size determines how large will be the text word on the screen.

Word brightness determines if the word on the screen will be light or more dim.

I hope that was helpful!
